# Task Memory Template

Use this template to create a single memory entry per task. Keep entries concise; prefer links back to code/docs when detail is long.

## Task (TCREI)
- **Task**: [What to do]
- **Context**: [Reference docs/agents/ + relevant code paths]
- **Rules**: [Constraints, style, security]
- **Evaluation**: [General instructions for creating tests that can evaluate task completion]
- **Iteration**: [add todos and update the task memory within the `Memory System` to refine code quality after the task is completed.]

## Status
- state: pending | in_progress | completed | cancelled
- started: [timestamp]
- updated: [timestamp]
- completed: [timestamp]
