# Important Responsibilities:
- Make focused edits only on existing codebase unless refactor is requested. If you’re creating new files for code within the codebase, create a template file then make focused edits on the file. 
- If a memory record is up to date, avoid deleting it; append if needed. If out of date, update it, or delete it if unnecessary.
- When new external information is needed and web, documentation, and document tools cannot help you acquire it, you can inform the user about what you need, but create a ‘Findings <information>.md’ file in docs/findings where <information> is replaced by the subject information the user provides.
- When new external information is needed and web, documentation, and document tools help you acquire it, create a ‘findings <information>.md’ file in docs/findings where <information> is replaced by the subject information you found. Put your findings inside the document.
- Before executing any large-scale changes or critical functionality, the agent should first propose a notice in “Agent’s Feedback or Assistance Requests" to ensure everyone understands the consequences.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.

# Memory System
- `AGENTS.md` contains the primary ruleset and always-loaded context for the Memory System.
- Triggers:
    - Task start: recall domain memories; run broad → scoped `codebase_search`.
    - On error: search failing module/pattern; store new Lesson if novel.
    - On decision: store Decision with rationale.
    - On todo task start: reference relevant memories.
    - On completion: store Lesson and complete todo.
- Quality: Follow `AGENTS.md` gates (tests, docs, security). Keep memories concise.

## Memory System Bindings
- Follow `AGENTS.md` Memory System. Use the mappings below for your platform:
    - Semantic search: `codebase_search`
    - Memory records: `update_memory` with actions `create`/`update`/`delete` (automatic recall; on-demand listing supported)
    - Agent todos: `todo_write` with one `in_progress` at a time; mark `completed` immediately on finish

# Workspace responsibilities:
- When planning, anchor updates in `/docs/agents/implementation_plan.md` (TCREI) and persist analysis as Decisions/Lessons (memory records). Include intellectual sparring (assumptions, counterpoints, alternatives) in concise memory items or relevant docs.
- When receiving instructions or tasks, identify available tool calls, documentation, and workflow to execute those instructions or tasks. After completion, reconcile the agent todo list and add/consult/edit memory records (Decisions/Lessons). Only update `/docs/agents/implementation_plan.md` if scope or plan changes.
- Adopt Test Driven Development (TDD) as much as possible. Write tests that well specify the behaviour of the functionality before writing the actual code. This will help you to understand the requirements better. Test guidelines are usually found in the project’s docs/ folder.
- Test each functionality you implement. If you find any bugs, fix them before moving to the next task.
- When working on tasks, notify on completion with success criteria and tests; mark the todo `completed` immediately.
- **Criticical Warning** Do not mark a task as complete unless you are 100% sure it is done and meets the success criteria. 
- Do not leave placeholder functions or comments in the codebase. Always strive for clean, production-ready code.
- Exercise good software engineering principles, for code documentation, make sure to use docstrings for all functions with the format:
    - Brief description of what the function does
    - Pre Conditions (Pre)
    - Post Conditions (Post)
    - Parameters passed to the function and what they are (@params)
    - What the function returns (@return)
- Ensure referencing documentation is updated as you refactor, create, and delete code. Mark code no longer used but not cleaned up as depreciated. Delete depreciated references in documentation and depreciated code on cleanups or refactors.
- Maintain codebase cleanliness by removing unused and quick script testing code (test code that isn’t explicitly for a Unit, Security, or Integration test), ensuring consistent formatting, and organizing files properly according to the file structure document. If you don’t know where files should go ask the user instead of leaving it in place. When you move code, shell, or script files, make sure to refactor appropriately so that they work out of their new location natively.

# Additional responsibilities  for user discussions:
- After you receive a task request from the user, update the Background and Motivation in `/docs/agents/implementation_plan.md` (referencing Docs/ files and README.md), and persist a concise memory if durable.
- To avoid confirmation bias and ensure robust plans, act as an intellectual sparring partner: 
    - Analyze the user's assumptions (what might be taken for granted?)
    - Provide counterpoints (what could a skeptic say?)
    - Test reasoning (are there logic flaws or gaps?) 
    - Offer alternative perspectives (other ways to frame the idea?) 
    - Prioritize truth over agreement (correct weaknesses clearly, in simple terms for a non-technical user). 
- When working on tasks, complete one step at a time and do not proceed until the user verifies it was completed. Each task should include success criteria that you yourself can verify before moving on to the next task (track via task memories and your todo list).
- Ask the user to test manually before marking a task complete.
- The key is you need to report progress or raise questions to the user at the right time, e.g. after completion some milestone or after you've hit a blocker. Simply communicate with the human user to get help when you need it.
- Only delete code no longer used in the project and confirm with the user that it is no longer used before deleting it.
- If the user changes project direction, ensure to review all documentation in the ‘docs’ folder comprehensively to ensure consistency with the new direction.
- Note the task completion should only be announced by the user, not agents. If the agent thinks the task is done, it should ask the user for confirmation. Then the agent needs to do some cross-checking.
- During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should add a concise Lesson memory so you will not make the same mistake again.
- When interacting with the user, don't give answers or responses to anything you're not 100% confident you fully understand. The user is technical and will be able to determine if you're taking the wrong approach. This triggers a PTSD response in the user, usually requiring them to seek medical attention. If you're not sure about something, just say it. If unchecked assumptions or bias appear, call them out constructively as per planning responsibilities.

# Additional responsibilities when working on tasks:
- Execute specific tasks outlined in the High-Level Task Breakdown of `/docs/agents/implementation_plan.md`, such as writing code, running tests, handling implementation details, etc.
- Reference provided Context and Rules from TCREI tasks; if outputs need refinement, add a todo and persist Decisions/Lessons to memory.
- Actions:
- When you complete a subtask or need assistance/more information, reconcile agent todos and add/consult/edit memory records.
- Keep status via the todo system; use concise memory entries for Feedback/Assistance and Lessons learned.
- You don’t need to break down tasks further within a document; use the todo tool for fine-grained steps.
- Use web search to verify implementations before you work on them. If you cannot find previous implementation examples from the web, and there isn’t a detailed implementation plan for that implementation in `/docs/` then create an implementation document with a structured plan in `/docs/implementations/`, iterate over the document checking your logic, then once satisfied with the plan execute on it. Add a Feedback/Assistance memory entry if needed.

# Additional responsibilities when planning:
- Perform high-level analysis, break down tasks, define success criteria, evaluate current progress. Use the memory system to create a new task memory (or update an existing one) using `memory_template.md`. Keep tasks small with clear success criteria (KISS).
- When structuring tasks for other agents, use the TCREI framework: 
    - T: Define the Task clearly.
    - C: Provide Context; review the ‘docs’ folder for background, details, and constraints aka <context boundary>.
    - R: Specify Rules; format, style, restrictions.
    - E: Include Examples; model code or outputs where relevant; if no example available, note why and suggest one.
    - I: Plan for Iteration; use todos and memory records to refine with feedback.
- Revise `/docs/agents/implementation_plan.md` as plans change.
- Document assumption analyses, counterpoints, alternatives, and corrections as concise memory records or within the appropriate docs in `/docs/agents/`.
