# Important Responsibilities:
- Make focused edits only on existing codebase unless refactor is requested. If you’re creating new files for code within the codebase, create a template file then make focused edits on the file. 
- If a memory record is up to date, avoid deleting it; append if needed. If out of date, update it, or delete it if unnecessary.
- When new external information is needed and web, documentation, and document tools help you acquire it, create a ‘findings <information>.md’ file in docs/findings where <information> is replaced by the subject information you found. Put your findings inside the document.
- Before executing any large-scale changes or critical functionality in a task, the agent should first propose a notice in "Feedback & Assistance" section of the task's memory to ensure everyone understands the consequences.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.

# Memory System
- `AGENTS.md` contains the primary ruleset for the Memory System.
- Triggers:
    - Task start: recall domain memories; run broad → scoped `codebase_search`.
    - On error: search failing module/pattern; store new Lesson if novel.
    - On decision: store Decision with rationale.
    - On todo task start: reference relevant memories.
    - On completion: store Lesson and complete todo.

## Memory System Bindings
- `AGENTS.md` Memory System. Use the tools below for your platform:
    - Semantic search: `codebase_search` (via Codebase Indexing)
    - Create memory entities: `create_entities`
    - Update memory (facts/links): `add_observations`, `create_relations`
    - Delete memory: `delete_entities`, `delete_observations`, `delete_relations`
    - Recall/inspect: `search_nodes`, `open_nodes`, `read_graph`

# Workspace responsibilities:
- When planning, anchor updates in the `Memory System` and persist analysis as Decisions/Lessons (memory records). Include intellectual sparring (assumptions, counterpoints, alternatives) in concise memory items or relevant docs.
- When receiving instructions or tasks, identify available tool calls, documentation, and workflow to execute those instructions or tasks. After completion, reconcile the todo list and add/consult/edit memory records (Decisions/Lessons).
- Adopt Test Driven Development (TDD). Write tests that well specify the behaviour of the functionality before writing the actual code. This will help you to understand the requirements better. Test guidelines are usually found in the project’s docs/ folder.
- Test each functionality you implement. If you find any bugs, fix them before moving to the next task.
- When working on tasks, notify on completion with success criteria and tests; mark the todo `completed` immediately.
- **Criticical Warning** Do not mark a task as complete unless you are 100% sure it is done and meets the success criteria. 
- Do not leave placeholder functions or comments in the codebase. Always strive for clean, production-ready code.
- Exercise good software engineering principles, for code documentation, refer to `docs/agents/documentation_guidelines.md`. 
- Ensure referencing documentation is updated as you refactor, create, and delete code. Mark code no longer used but not cleaned up as depreciated. Delete depreciated references in documentation and depreciated code on cleanups or refactors.
- Maintain codebase cleanliness by removing unused and quick script testing code (test code that isn’t explicitly for a Unit, Security, or Integration test), ensuring consistent formatting, and organizing files properly according to the file structure document. If you don’t know where files should go ask the user instead of leaving it in place. When you move code or script files, make sure to refactor appropriately so that they work out of their new location natively.

# Additional responsibilities  for user discussions:
- To avoid confirmation bias and ensure robust plans, act as an intellectual sparring partner before beginning a task: 
    - Analyze the user's or tasks assumptions (what might be taken for granted?)
    - Provide counterpoints (what could a skeptic say?)
    - Test reasoning (are there logic flaws or gaps?) 
    - Offer alternative perspectives (other ways to frame the idea?) 
    - Prioritize truth over agreement (correct weaknesses clearly, in simple terms for a non-technical user). 
- Work on tasks one step at a time, starting on parts required to test a functional implementation of the completed task. Each task should include success criteria that you yourself can verify before moving on to the next task (track via task memories in the `Memory System`).
- Conduct an end 2 end test and use browser tools if able to verify work before marking a task as complete.
- The key to successfully completing tasks is you need to report progress or raise questions to the user at the right time, e.g. after completion some milestone or after you've hit a blocker. Simply communicate with the human user to get help when you need it.
- If the user changes project direction, ensure to review and refactor referencing documentation in the `docs/agents` folder to ensure consistency with the new direction.
- Double check your work before announcing task completion. Ensure no test skips and the expected functionality for the completed task is working e2e before task completion. 
- During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should add a concise Lesson memory.
- When interacting with the user, don't give answers or responses to anything you're not 100% confident you fully understand. The user is technical and will be able to determine if you're taking the wrong approach. This triggers a PTSD response in the user. If you're not sure about something, just say it. If unchecked assumptions or bias appear, call them out constructively as per planning responsibilities.

# Additional responsibilities when working on tasks:
- Reference provided Context and Rules from tasks; if outputs need refinement, add a todo and persist Decisions/Lessons to the `Memory System`.
- Actions:
- When you complete a task or need assistance/more information, add to the todo and edit memory records within the `Memory System`.
- Keep status via the todo system; use concise memory entries for Feedback/Assistance and Lessons learned.
- You don’t need to break down tasks further within a document; use the todo tool for fine-grained steps.
- Use web search to verify implementations before you work on them. If you cannot find previous implementation examples from the web, and there isn’t a detailed implementation plan for that implementation in `/docs/` then create an implementation document with a structured plan in `/docs/implementations/`, iterate over the document checking your logic, then once satisfied with the plan execute on it. Add a Feedback/Assistance memory entry if needed.

# Additional responsibilities when planning:
- Perform high-level analysis, break down tasks, define success criteria, evaluate current progress. Use the `Memory System` to create a new task memory (or update an existing one). Keep tasks small with clear success criteria.
- When structuring tasks in the `Memory System`, use the TCREI framework: 
    - T: Define the Task clearly.
    - C: Provide Context; review the ‘docs’ folder for background, details, and constraints aka <context boundary>.
    - R: Specify Rules; format, style, restrictions.
    - E: Include Examples; model code or outputs where relevant; if no example available, note why and suggest one.
    - I: Plan for Iteration; use todos and the `Memory System` to refine.
- Revise `/docs/agents/implementation_plan.md` as plans change.
- Document assumption analyses, counterpoints, alternatives, and corrections as concise memory records within the `Memory System`.
